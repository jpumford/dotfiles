 # Messages
 # # ===============================================================
 # # There are two kinds of messages:  "activity" and "bell"
 # # They are also the names of the commands that set the
 # # respective messages.  In every message there can be "meta
 # # strings" which are replaced by values.  A meta string starts
 # # with a percent sign and is then followed by one of the
 # # following letters: aAdDmMnstwWyY The meta strings refer to
 # # the current date and time or to a window title or number:
 # #   %t - title
 # #   %n - number (a single % still works)
 # #   %d - day
 # #   %D - weekday name
 # #   %m - month
 # #   %M - month name
 # #   %y - year (2 digit)
 # #   %Y - year (4 digit)
 # #   %w - hour:minutes (24h format)
 # #   %W - hour:minutes (12h format)
 # #   %s - seconds
 # #   %a - am/pm
 # #   %A - AM/PM
 # # Older versions of screen used a single '%' character
 # # for window titles - but since version 3.7 this is
 # # obsoleted by '%n' and will vanish in future releases!
 # # So please update your screenrc to meet this convention!
